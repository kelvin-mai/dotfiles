    family: UbuntuMono Nerd Font

  # The `style` can be specified to pick a specific face.
  #style: Regular

  # Bold font face
  #bold:
  # Font family
  #
  # If the bold family is not specified, it will fall back to the
  # value specified for the normal font.

  # The `style` can be specified to pick a specific face.

  # Italic font face
  #italic:
  # Font family

  # If the italic family is not specified, it will fall back to the
  # value specified for the normal font.
  #family: monospace

  # The `style` can be specified to pick a specific face.
  #style: Italic

  # Point size
  size: 18.0

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought of
  # as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter spacing.
  offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with

  # Thin stroke font rendering (macOS only)
  #
  # Thin strokes are suitable for retina displays, but for non-retina screens
  # it is recommended to set `use_thin_strokes` to `false`
  #
  # macOS >= 10.14.x:
  #
  # If the font quality on non-retina display looks bad then set
  # `use_thin_strokes` to `true` and enable font smoothing by running the
  # following command:
  #   `defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO`
  #
  # This is a global setting and will require a log out or restart to take
  # effect.
  use_thin_strokes: true

# If `true`, bold text is drawn using the bright color variants.
